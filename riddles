                           Hopeâ€™s Advice

------------------------------------------
Hope tried to speak
My future it tried to leak
He said: Much will happen this week
So long that you know what you seek
Love will make you weak
Stop counting the days; be unique
Just try and let your heart sneak
--------------------------------------------
Question: How many days were counted while taking hope's advice?
Hint: Language can be funny sometimes: one word in the poem can represents the count ðŸ˜‡
